<b>Focus</b>: See Fantastic Four
* Super-Skrull uses the Fantastic Four's abilities with a twist, focusing Attack instead of Recruit.
<b>Man and Woman Out of Time</b>: See Captain America 75th Anniversary
* You can use a Focus ability on a Man Out of Time card throughout the first and second turns you play the card.
* If a special ability lets you copy (or play a copy of) a Hero card, you can't use Man Out of Time on the copy.
* Some enemies send your cards Out of Time, setting them aside in the same way. When you play and discard that card at the start of your next turn, you can't use Man Out of Time again.
<b>Momentum</b>
The Annihilation Wave is a fast-moving invasion force. While pushing forward, they feed on the resources of new territory, becoming more powerful. This is represented by the new "Momentum" keyword.
* Some Villains say things like "Momentum 3." This means <b>"This Villain gets +3 Attack if it entered another city space this turn."</b>
* This works on the turn the Villain enters the city. It also works on any other turn when it is pushed into another city space by another Villain, or by a special ability moving or swapping it to another space.
* The Mastermind Annihilus has a variant "<b>Mass Momentum 2.</b>" This means <b>he gets +2 Attack for each Villain currently in the city that entered a new city space this turn.</b> (This doesn't include Villains who entered the Escape Pile this turn.)
* For both Momentum and Mass Momentum, it doesn't matter how many different city spaces a Villain entered during a turn. It only matters if it entered any new spaces at all.
* If a board gets complicated, with special abilities moving Villains around, some players like to shift Momentum Villains up a bit to help signal that they have entered a new space this turn.
