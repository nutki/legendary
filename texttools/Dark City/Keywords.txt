{BRIBE}: You can fight villains with the keyword "{BRIBE}" by spending any combination of Attack and/or Recruit points. For example, you may play two S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents and two S.H.I.E.L.D. Troopers to fight the +4 Attack Maggia Goons."

{VERSATILE}: When you play a card with the keyword "{VERSATILE}" you must first choose between Recruit and Fight. Once you have chosen, the card provides recruit or fight equal to the {VERSATILE} value. For example, {VERSATILE 3} gives you +3 Recruit or +3 Attack.
