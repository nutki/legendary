<b>Cheering Crowds</b>: This keyword represents the Champions being inspired to redouble their efforts by adoring fans.
* Several Hero cards say "Cheering Crowds." This means "You may play this card twice in a row if you return a Bystander from your Victory Pile to the bottom of the Bystander Stack."
Example 1: Say you have a Hero that gives 1 Recruit and says "Draw a card. <b>Cheering Crowds</b>." As you play this Hero, you could return a Bystander to play the Hero twice in a row, getting 2 Recruit and drawing two cards.
* Essentially you play the card itself, and then you play a bonus copy of that card.
Example 2: Say your first play of the turn was an [Instinct] card that gives 2 Attack and says "[Instinct]: Draw a card. <b>Cheering Crowds</b>." You decide to return a Bystander to play this card twice in a row. The first play wouldn't get to use the "[Instinct]: Draw a card" ability, since you haven't played an [Instinct] card earlier in the turn. However, the second play would get to use that Superpower ability, since you have now played an [Instinct] card earlier in the turn. So you would end up getting 4 Attack and drawing one card.
* If you had played a different [Instinct] card before doubling the Cheering Crowds card, then you could would get to use the "[Instinct]: Draw a card" ability both times, getting 4 Attack and drawing two cards.
Example 3: Say your first play is using Cheering Crowds to play a [Tech] card twice. Then, you play another card that says "[Tech]: You get +1 Attack for each other [Tech] Hero you played this turn." That ability would count both plays of your Cheering Crowds card, giving you +2 Attack total.
* When playing out a big turn, some people like to put the Bystander they're returning temporarily on the Cheering Crowds card to remind themselves they've played it twice.
...
* If you use Cheering Crowds to play a {VERSATILE} card twice, you could get Recruit with one play and get Attack with the other play, or choose the same for both.
<b>Size-Changing</b>: This keyword represents Heroes and Villains using superpowers to stretch or massively change their size. It's also used by characters that can change the size of a weapon, technology, or energy. It first appeared in <i>Legendary: Civil War</i>, but in this set it has a new twist.
...
* As a new Twist, some Heroes and Villains in this set say things like "<b>Size-Changing</b>: [Strength], [Covert]." If you played any [Strength] Heroes this turn, the cost is 2 less. If you played any [Covert] Heroes, the cost is 2 less. If you played both a [Strength] Hero and a [Covert] Hero this turn, then the cost is 4 less.
* Fin Fang Foom and one of his Monsters Unleashed even say "<b>Size-Changing</b>: [Strength], [Instinct], [Covert], [Tech], [Ranged]". You can pay 2 Attack less to fight them for each of these Hero Classes you played this turn.
* Note: For any Size-Changing card, it doesn't matter how many Heroes you played -- it only maters whether or not you played any Heroes of that Hero class.
* After you've recruited a card, Size-Changing doesn't do anything else on that card.
* If a Hero in the HQ already has "<b>Size-Changing</b>: [Tech]" and it gains "<b>Size-Changing</b>: [Tech], [Ranged]" from another special ability like the Sporr Villain, it just ends up with "<b>Size-Changing</b>: [Tech], [Ranged]." A card can't have Size-Changing for the same Hero Class twice.
