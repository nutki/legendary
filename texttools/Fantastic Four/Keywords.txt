<b>Focus</b>: When you play a card with a Focus ability, you can pay the cost on the left side of the arrow to get the effect on right side of the arrow. You can use that Focus ability as many times as you want for the rest of the turn. You can even play more Heroes, recruit, fight, then use the Focus ability more.
Note: You can use Focus abilities and still use the "Healing" ability on Wounds.

<b>Burrow</b>: This means "Fight: If the Streets were empty, put this Villain back into the Streets." When you fight a Villain with Burrow, do all of that Villain's Fight effects. You rescue any Bystanders the Villain may have captured as normal. Then, if the "Streets" city space was empty, put that Villain back into the Streets space. If you fight a Villain with Burrow twice in a turn, you'll do that Villain's Fight effects twice. Cards that do something "when you defeat" a Villain still work if the Villain burrows to the Streets. When a Villain burrows to the Streets, it does not do any Ambush effects

<b>Cosmic Threat</b>: If an enemy has Cosmic Threat: Ranged, that means: "For each Ranged card you reveal, this Enemy gets -3 Attack this turn." (An asterisk next to an Enemy's Attack number is to remind you that their Attack can change. The asterisk doesn't mean anything else.)

Galactus' Cosmic Threat means "Once per turn, choose Strength, Instinct, Covert, Tech or Ranged. For each card of that color you reveal, this Enemy gets -3 Attack for one fight this turn." If you try to fight Galactus a second time in the same turn, he will return to his full attack and you cannot use his Cosmic Threat ability a second time that turn.
